{{MODE_PREFIX}}
- After a successful replace, the response shows the change summary. {{AUTO_READ_GUIDANCE}}
- On [E_STALE_ANCHOR], call read to get fresh anchors, copy the full "line:hash" anchor of the start and end of the range into hash_range_inclusive, and retry.
- hash_range_inclusive replaces the ENTIRE range inclusively. Every line from the first anchor through the second anchor is deleted. Only put replacement lines in content_lines — do not include lines that already exist outside the range.
- Preserve leading whitespace exactly. The content after │ in read output includes all leading spaces and tabs — copy them into content_lines unchanged.
- content_lines must be a native JSON array of strings, not a JSON string.
